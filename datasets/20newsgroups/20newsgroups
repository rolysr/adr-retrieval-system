Say, you bought your Saturn at $13k, with a dealer profit of $2k.
If the dealer profit is $1000, then you would only be paying $12k for
the same car.  So isn't that saving money?

Moreover, if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by $1000, 
then their cars will be even better deals.  Say, if the price of a Saturn was
already $1000 below market average for the class of cars, then after they
reduce the dealer profit, it would be $2000 below market average.  It will:

1) Attract even more people to buy Saturns because it would SAVE THEM MONEY.
 
2) Force the competitors to lower their prices to survive.

Now, not only will Saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit, even 
the buyers for other cars will pay less.

Isn't that saving money?

sure sounds like they got a ringer.  the 325is i drove was definitely
faster than that.  if you want to quote numbers, my AW AutoFile shows
0-60 in 7.4, 1/4 mile in 15.9.  it quotes Car and Driver's figures
of 6.9 and 15.3.  oh, BTW, these numbers are for the 325i.

i don't know how the addition of variable valve timing for 1993 affects it.
but don't take my word for it.  go drive it.

That my be, but every Volvo I've ever owned has lasted far longer than most
other cars.....
1981 Volvo 245....125,000 Miles, still on the road.
1983 Volvo 242....195,000 Miles, still on the road.
1984 Volvo 244....175,000 Miles, still on the road.
And I'll admit, the dealer repair cost is high. But with some mechanical
aptitude of your own, and finding a good indi mechanic, you can avoid most
breakdowns, and make the rest cheap(The sum total of the repairs on the car with
195,000 miles has been 2 mufflers and a radiator. Whoa. Bad repair record). 
And all of these cars are driven fairly hard. None of them are at the head of
a line of cars going 30 MPH....the first two spend a lot of their operating
life with the speedometer pegged...and the only reason the 84 doesn't is it has
a 120 MPH speedo...
What I want to know is....have all you people who hate Volvos been traumatized
by someone in a 745 Turbo wagon blowing you away on the road, or what?

I'm looking for a replacement radio/tape player for a 1984 
Toyota Tercel.  Standard off-the-shelf unit is fine, but 
every place I've gone to (Service Merchandise, etc.) doesn't 
have my car in its model application book.  I want to just 
take out the old radio, and slide in the new, with minimal time

If you have put in a new unit in a similar car, I'd like to hear
what brand,  how easy it was to do the change, and any other 
relevant information. 

Please answer via E-mail.

Subject: 1993 Infiniti G20


I am thinking about getting an Infiniti G20.
In consumer reports it is ranked high in many
catagories including highest in reliability index for compact cars.
Mitsubushi Galant was second followed by Honda Accord).

A couple of things though:
1) In looking around I have yet to see anyone driving this
   car. I see lots of Honda's and Toyota's.
2) There is a special deal where I can get an Infinity G20, fully
   loaded, at dealer cost (I have check this out and the numbers match
   up). They are doing this because they are releasing and update mid-1993
   version (includes dual air-bags) and want to get rid of their old 1993's.

I guess my question is: Is this a good deal? 
Also, Can anyone give me any feedback on Infiniti?

Thanks,

Carl Hoffman

P.S.

The other cars that I have test driven and which are in the
running are:
Mitsubishi Galant, Honda Accord, and Toyota Camary

Doesn't work too well if the engine is hot, its more accurate to check the
oil when the engine is cool, i.e. not when you are at a gas station.

Why don't you look again at Motor Trend's, slalom times, they are 67.9, right
along with the Integra, and the car does that with small 14 inch tires that
are all -weather XGTV4, not to mention that the Integra rides alot better than
a Beretta.
Your acceleartion times also vary, magazine to magazine
Road & Track and Car& Driver have the GS-R at 6.8 to 8.0 for Road and Track.
Also Quarter mile times vary from 15.4 to 16.1
You can't tell exactly by the numbers.  Furthermore, the Integra will
definately outrun the Beretta on the high end.  Car & Driver and Road & track
have the GS-R doing 136 to 141 mph, and it gets there fast.

***You always believe those exact numbers, why don't you drive a GS-R, and see
for your self, while the GS-R has a low 117 torqye, its high gearing over a 8000
rpm make up for the difference (still wouldn't call it a torque moster though!)

Quad 4 reliable, yeah, what's your definition of reliable- if that's reliable,
then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect
 (not to mention, a hell of alot smoother and quieter - balance shafts.The Acura has the engine
   wins the reliablity contest hands down. You can rev that car all day, everyday,
and you'll never blow a hose, or crack the block, or anything else. (I speak
from expierence!)
I'm not saying the Quad 4 is a bad engine, but don't highlight reliability when you
comparing it to a Acura Engine.  AND while the Integra costs alot more, it is a
better investment since it will hold its value considerably much better.  And
does a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time.

NOTE: this isn't a flame on the GTZ, or other GM Quad 4 products.  THe Berreta
is a nice car, and puts out respectable performance and a very reasonable
price not to mention, it has an Airbag.  But to start quoting figures from one
source, isn't too reliable.  Read other sources, and drive both cars.  While I
haven't driven a GTZ, I have driven GTs, and Grand Ams with Quad 4 engines,
(so they are similair.)

Any advice on HOW to buy a Land Cruiser? My local Toyota dealer says they
get two a year, and if I want one I can just get on the waiting list.
Forget about a test drive or even kicking the tires.
And if they are that rare, I doubt there is much of a parts inventory on
hand.

	Yes, there are still alot of MGBs out there.  The earlier cars (pre
 74-1/2) are usually more desirable due to certain things that went with having 
chrome bumpers (ride height, generally more power).  The older cars are 
appreciating... slowly.  The newer ones seem to be at a stable level at the 
moment.  $6 to $8k would require extremely good condition and low miles.
If the car is in good shape and regular maintenance is kept up on it, the car 
should last for a long time.  There are still plenty of parts sources ouththere. 
 The MGB is a great, fun little car.  If she is keeping it solely in the hopes 
that it is going to appreciate, tell her to sell it.  It is not worth waiting 
the time it would take to appreciate to a real profitable level.

Subject: Re: Advice on BMWs and winter driving

This past winter I drove from NYC to Killington,VT 6 or 7 times in my
1990 325i Convertible (talk about poor reputation in the snow!!)
with an EXCELLENT set of snow tires. I put 4 Noika NR10s on in Dec. and have been 
sure footed in some pretty severe weather conditions ever since. I've plowed through
4 - 5 inch snow covered roads effortlessly, while other cars have been paralyzed
(front wheel drive included).

Concentrate more on "where the rubber meets the road" rather than driveability of cars
in snowy conditions. Drive carefully, buy good snow tires, and most cars will perform
adequately in less than ideal conditions.

An aside: 
I can't praise Noika NR10 snows enough. Absolutely the BEST snow tires I have ever
driven on. If you live in the snow belt, do yourself a favor and get a set of these
next winter.

Any reason you are limited to the two mentioned? They aren't really at
the same point along the SUV spectrum - not to mention price range.
How about the Explorer, Trooper, Blazer, Montero, and if the budget
allows, the Land Cruiser? 
Bear in mind that 90% of all SUV's purchased never venture off-road.
Carefully weigh the trade-off between comfort and off-road performance
when choosing one, and realistically decide whether you'll actually
make enough use of the off-road-ability to sacrifice (some of) the
on-road comfort.

How many people will actually put that money in the bank and keep it there for the

extended warranty is worth it.....for some people it is worth it...others not, and

is enough.....if you drive a lot, your basic warranty can be up in a little longer than

It may work for some people......

This has me thinking.  Is there a biological reason why women can't put
their keys in their pants pockets like men do?  I have two pockets on the
back of each of my pants.  I put my keys in one and wallent in another.
Many of the pockets even have a botton on them so I can close them securely.
Everything is that much simpler for me.  Why can't women do the same?
Is is biological (ie, not enough room for a bigger bottom plus keys and
a wallet) or is it the way they are raised by the parents?

Subject: '93 Ford Probe GT -- Engine problems?

One of the local dealers has a used (7k miles) '93 Probe GT
on the lot with a photocopy of a document taped to the
window saying the dealership bought the car back from
the previous owner because of "Engine noises", but that
the Ford district rep had OK'ed the car saying those
noises were "normal".  I thought it was worth looking
into (the car seems otherwise clean) and mentioned this
to a co-worker, who proceeded to tell me a horror story
about her son's '93 Probe GT, which had several problems,
ending with engine noises which she said "was something
with the heads", that Ford acknowledged the noise, said
they were working on it, but didn't have a cure as of
yet.  Her son traded the car in (and I checked -- not
the same car).  So I have some evidence of a reoccuring
problem with the V6 in the Probe GT's, and by extension
with the Madza 626 and MX-6.

Anything to this?  I'd love to consider buying the GT (I'm
turning 40 -- time for my scheduled mid life crisis :-)
but I'd hate to find out I just became the proud owner
of a Lemon.

It's great that all these other cars can out-handle, out-corner, and out-

But, you've got to ask yourself one question: do all these other cars have
a moonroof with a sliding sunshade?  No wimpy pop-up sunroofs or power
sliding roofs that are opaque.  A moonroof that can be opened to the air,
closed to let just light in, or shaded so that nothing comes in.

We're considering getting a Ford Explorer XLT with 4WD and we have the
following questions (All we would do is go skiing -- no off-roading):

1. With 4WD, do we need the "performance axle" - (limited slip axle).
Its purpose is to allow the tires to act independently when the tires
are on different terrain. 

2. Do we need the all-terrain tires (P235/75X15) or will the
all-season (P225/70X15) be good enough for us at Lake Tahoe?


Thanks,

Bottom line:  I did it and it worked.

Some 'tips and techniques' are included here:

I found that I needed some smaller sockets to undo the shocks.
And a can of WD40 helped...

The sockets needed were metric (exact fit) but I was able to use
some SAE sockets...  13/16 and 15/16 are rather close to 21 and 24mm...
It CAN be fun having a Canadian Ford ...

>Sounds about right.

Didn't have to undo the end bolts/bushings.  Just the 2 U bolts on
each side and the shock absorber.  Jacking up the frame some more
(had to put the spare tire on the garage floor and put a wooden 
platform on top of that to get the 'floor jack' high enough to
raise the frame ... I't one TALLL truck...) lifted the spring
free of the axel.  Taking out the block gave me enough room to
undo the pin holding the spring pack together.

The spring pack was held together with a nut on top and a round head
on the other end....  No wrench head...  Vice Grips worked fine...
I soaked the nut with WD40 and it came right off.

Flipped the bottom spring and then...

>
>Well, it's easier than doing a decent trigger job on a 1911A1 :-)
>(OK, well, maybe it's not _that_ easy, but it's not terribly

I donno ... I'm a little more sore today than after working on a
1911A1 ...

A 1.5 foot pipe cheater was a real help.  Torque spec for the U bolt
nuts is 150 to 200 ft-lbs (!).   A 1911-A1 doesn't have that kind of
torque spec ...

It was a 'challenge' to get the 'pack bolt' back in the spring pack.  
Squeeze pack with two hands, hold bolt with third, put nut on
with fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifth
and sixth hands ...  I used some string to tie the pack together
while holding the pin in for alignment... then I could let go
to get the {nut, wrench, Vice Grips...}.

Getting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too...
until I discovered that the axel had 1) Tilted and/or 2) rolled forward.

One the drivers side, a bottle jack under the front of the differential
tilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right
hole.  On the passenger side, I had to wrestle the wheel into rolling
forward about 1/2 inch to get things to line up.  Spent more than an
hour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block
with levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before I took a 
break and thought about WHY it wasn't lined up anymore (since it HAD
been lined up before, and *I* didn't move it, something ELSE must 
have ... hmmm, axle no longer constrained not to move ... hmmm, move 
it back... hmmm...).

After that, it was all much easier to 'close up'.

BTW, the ride is now softer, but not quite as soft as I was hoping for.
At least it now sits level..

My Honda has a cable release that can be locked out with the ignition key.
The valet key can be left with someone and will NOT unlock the trunk
or enable the cable release.

I remember my mothers '86 Corvette that had an electronic hatch release
located on the drivers door, which was ALWAYS active.  The fact that the
car had no real trunk makes the security measure of beign able to 
dis-able the hatch release unnecessary.

 My friend brought a subaru SVX recently.  I had drove it for couples times and I
think its a great car, esp on snow.  However when she took it to a local Subaru
dealer for a oil change, the bill came out to be about 80 dollars.  The dealer
told us it is because to change the oil filter on a SVX it is necessary to
disassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour.
At first, we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in Toronto
but found out the they are charging roughly the same price.  So is there any
SVX owner out there that has the same problem ?  And if the oil change story is
true, then the engineer of Subaru looks pretty stubid to me. By the way, the car
looks great.

Comparing the GTZ and GSR is apples to oranges, somewhat like a Mustang 5.0
and a CRX, both have very different ways of doing things and ought to
appeal to different buyers, i.e., I don't think an Acura owner would
be seen dead in a Chevy dealership or vice versa.

The C+D figures are almost certainly bogus and based on a hot prototype

The GSR gearing is horrible for day to day driving. It needs a 6 speed
box more than any other modern car. Essentially 5th in a regualr Integra
equals 4th in the GSR, and the regular Integras are very buzzy at speed.

The only GSR owner I know had the engine throw a rod with less than 5k

Both the GTZ and GSR are flawed cars. The performance enthusiasts would take
the GTZ and the CR purchase would be the GSR.

Grass Roots Motorsport [3/93] has a long article about MG/B's this month.
As far as collectivity/speculation is concerned they think it is a 
waste of time, especially the later rubber bumpered models are the least
desirable, a 1962 original model the most. The reasons for its low
value are easy availability and the fact that it just was not a very good

Your Passat VR6 is designed to run on premium gasoline, however the
engine electronics will retard the timing so that no harm wil be done
to the engine with lower octane fuel.

You will likely, however, get somewhat more power and fuel mileage
(especially in hot weather) out of this particular engine if you do

Your best bet is the Dodge Intrepid with the SOHC 24 valve 3.4? six.
it gets 214 hp, and has a hell of a lot of room, great styling, and

  I won't argue too much about anything.  I am probably one of those that 
think that we can't have enough safety on the roads.  I would gladly 
sacrifice distractions (as you call it), than someone having trouble seeing
danger earlier.  One saved life justifies more than my lifetime of "distractions"
for me.

   Problem is that, I may just kill the guy. I agree that I would be at fault,
and I will have my license revoked, why, I might even go to the gas chamber.
But the fact still remains that the guy is dead.  Someone died because I
was too stingy to put on my lights.

   The ratio of the probability of fallen trees/rocks on the roads to 
oncoming traffic is too low to even be considered.  The difference is also
working on what we *know* could happen, to what *might* happen.

it is miniscule!

Oh PULLEEZE!

It's not biology at all, it's clothing design.  Women's clothing is
generally designed to be as non-functional as possible.  It's only been
in the last five years or so that you could buy women's pants with
pockets deep enough to carry anything in.  Previously, deep pockets were
virtually unknown in women's clothing.  Skirts generally have better
pockets now, too.  Dresses, espcially fancy dresses, are still pretty
hopeless.  I often hand my driver's license over to my husband if we're
dressed up to go out somewhere, so I don't have to be encumbered by a
purse.

If women consistently bought functional clothing, and boycotted the
manufacturers who refuse to make functional women's clothing, I think
manufacturers would tend to bow to market pressures.  There's
an interesting chapter in Susan Faludi's Backlash that described
what happened the LAST time clothing manufacturers ignored the
need for functional women's clothing.  The manufactuing industry
lost millions.

From a woman who would rather buy men's clothing WITH decent pockets and
long legs and high waists than women's clothing without....

 Seems that the 1993 Mustang 5.0 is rated at 205 hp ONLY because Ford
 changed its testing procedures.  Under the older procedures, it still 
 rates closer to 225 hp.  That means that the Mustang has 3 hp more.
 
 And you still haven't posted any weight figures for the Mustang.

 Yeah, sure, in your wet dreams.  And that's probably where you got

In article <foo> Brad Thone <C09615BT@WUVMD> writes:
Well, there *is* a difference.

I don't happen to have my SAE manual handy, but oil viscosity in general
_decreases_ with temperature.  The SAE numbers are based on a `typical'
curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a
room-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature 
5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.

Oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have
a weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly
cold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold
place, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer,
to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.

Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature.
As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis
specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating
temperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).

In any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember
that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and
radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or
something.

Any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized
oil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature,
thicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature, 
but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.  

If you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine
(esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives,
stick to the 10W40.

These arethe numbers I have been stating in the past 5-10 messages. It
really angers me that you insisted you were right, and that you had
no clue what your own car weighed. Why didn't you check when I first
told you that your figures were implausible?

No, sorry your wrong again. *You* quoted the del Sol as doing 0-60 in
8.1 according to C+D. Interestingly, the Stealth ES, which is
*faster* than your RT does the samerun in 8.5 seconds according to
C+D. Kind of embarassing isn't it? Why didn't you check the figures

before posting? It only makes you look stupid when you are caught out
twice with *your own* figures.

If you insist, I gave you every chance to retract, but:

  Dodge Stealth ES Auto does an 8.5/16.4 - Wonder why you couldn't find it?

Do you realize that a 9k Sentra (C+D) will run a 16.7, that a Sentra SE-R or Saturn
will run in the 15's? Don't you think it is kind of strange that your
222hp sports car is so easily beaten. 

A Mustang 5.0, which weights about the same (according to *your* numbers),
has less power and is much quicker? Care to explain. Don't be abusive,
just try and come up with a rational explanation of where those 222hp
went to, its a mystery to me.

By the 1920s, there was a very active "good roads" movement, which had
its origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze, picked up
steam in the teens (witness the Linclon Highway Association, 1912 or so,
and the US highway support act (real name: something different) in 1916
that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent
roads. Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic
transport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were
crucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plenty
of good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly
expanding into the countryside.  This was the era, after all, of the
first auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two good
books on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco "America on the
Road" (title may not be exact - author is) and another called "The Devil
Wagon in God's Country" author I forget.  Also, any of John Flink's  or
John Bell Rae's auto histories.

As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early
teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel
on the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the
right, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller
instead of a wheel.  This was standardized fairly early on, though I
don't know why.

--Let me put it like this.  The only similarity between the three models
  is the "300", or 3-liter engine displacement.  Actually, the SC300 (the
  coupe) and the GS300 (the funky-looking new sedan) share the same 3.0
  liter inline-six, and the ES300 (popular small sedan) uses 3.0 V6 shared
  with the Camry.  The SC300 is a luxury/sports coupe, the GS300 is the new
  luxury sedan, and the ES300 is the base executive sedan.  All three look
  completely different.

	Yes.  But the point is that prices are competetive.  Saturn may
well be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a $2000 profit, but 
since a comperable Honda with $500 profit is more expensive, it may be well
worth it to buy the Saturn.

	Not necessarily.  It seems to me that Saturn salesdroids, who don't 
make a commision, whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generally
do, make more $$ per hour or whatever.  This means that Saturn doesn't give up
the profit to their employees through commision, which IS taken out of per-
car profits.  They just pass it along to less pressureing salesmen/women.

>Isn't that saving money?

	Maybe.  Maybe not.  Depends on accounting practices.  I'd rather pay
more for dealer service that doesn't cut corners to contain costs...

My T-Bird SC's manual says to replace the platinum plugs every 60,000mi.
Wal-Mart has Autolite platinum plugs for $2.00 each. Are these "real"
platinum plugs? (I had Bosch platinums in my '80 Fiesta and my dad

very long (much less than 50,000mi) before they had to be replaced.
I agree that they weren't the greatest.)

	I agree that a fully-loaded SL2 would come close in price to a
LOWER-END Ford Taurus.  A FULLY-LOADED Taurus, on the other hand, would still
be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy SL2.  A fully loaded
SL2 would run somewhere around $17,000, while a fully loaded Taurus LX would be
somewhere around the $22,000-$23,000 range.  A base Taurus (GL I believe) might
start around $15,000.  Of course there is the Taurus SHO which can push $30,000
if you really try, but this is a totally different car than your mainstream
Taurus sedan.  Your statement was not entirely faulty, just a little
inaccurate.

Well, that's ok.  At least you're not bitching about dealer profits like some
of the other netters are.  You seem to have rationally picked out the car that
is best for you.  The Loyale is an aging design that is about to be replaced by
the Impreza wagon, so you probably got a good deal on one of the last ones.

	My GS came with XGT V4s and they are NOT all weather tires.  I took
out my right front bumper sliding on packed snow (not ice), before I learned
this fact.  I immediately bought XGT H4s which are definately all-weather.
A Carrera 4 I walk by everyday has XGT V4s on it even.  The Michelin dealer
where I bought my new tires said the V4s were made out of a different 
rubber that gets really hard and slick when the weather gets near feezing.  
Said he'd only try to sell me those tires during the winter if we were in
Texas and not Colorado.

Thanks,

While your 0-60 time is consistent with most car magazines and reports, I saw
the PBS MotorWeek show clock a 5-speed SL2 at 7.9 seconds.  I'm sure that most
SL2 owners will be VERY lucky to get this speed, but 7.9 seconds is still
astonishingly fast for a small 4-door.  A new Civic EX runs about 8.2 seconds
0-60, if I'm not mistaken.  Most cars in this class are lucky to be in the
9-second range.

   As I live in Sweden I remember the day perfectly well. We changed
side 1967-09-03 (or 03-SEP-1967). I don't remeber the exactly time but
it was in the night. (in the 'big' cities like Stockholm & Gothenburg
all trafic was forbidden, exept busses and taxis, during the whole
weekend.) The day was a Sunday and everything was prepared in before.

Before the day we was told to follow the yellow lines on the road and
after it was the white one that matters. The signs with arrows on was
prepared with a 'left mode' label that was torn off that night to
reveal the new right mode arrow.

The year after Iceland also changed.

About cars: Before the H-day (H as in "Hoegertrafik". "hoeger" is
Swedish and stands for 'right') practically all cars already had their
steering wheels on the left side. Even the imported cars from UK had
the wheel on 'the right side'. At last we have cars with the wheels on
the right side. :-)

More contries that uses the left side is:

Japan
Tanzania (I think)
New Zeeland
How about South Africa?

BTW. Some sais that the left side is the right side because Ivanhoe
and other knights meet at the left when they fight in tournaments. :-)

740 Turbo in UK was good for 124mph. Useful for blowing away VW Beetles, though I
believe the Beetle corners better. 

I can say without any doubt that I have never been blown away by any Volvo, ever.
I've been blocked into a few car parks though by shit-head Volvo owners who 'only thought they'd be a few minutes'. This does not happen with the owners of any other makes of car.

Not sure how long the small shit-box Volvos last - too damn long. The worst car I ever drove was a hired 340. In power, handling and ride it was reminiscent of something
from the 50s, without the character. The 340 only ceased production a couple of years back. I've only been a passenger in the big Volvos, but that was enough. I ought to go
for a test drive because they offer some neat gifts.

I understand Caddy is working on one, double battery, super high perf

The problem is that the guy at 1600 Penn. Avenue is about to get it

Not to my knowledge; I know GM does conversion work for things like 
hot climates (i.e. the Chevy Caprices sold to the Middle East) but 
things like that are always done by third parties, NOT the manufacturer.
Maybe you will need to buy a specific package that has beefed-up everything,
perhaps the police cruiser package on the Caprice/Crown Vic and start from
there.

"And I wuz drivin' along in my armored Seville STS and this punk pulls out
of nowhere with an RPG (Rocket Propelled Grenade) but the bulletproof
windshield stopped him" :-) Don't think many people on the net have a need
for bulletproof cars. 

Check with local armored service companies/security/bodyguard places. They'd
know best. I think your average luxury car dealer will have a coronary if
you told them "I'll take the blue Caprice, with options FZ01 (Fuzzy Dice),
PR11 (power everything), and AR007 (Armor).

Bad driving habits can damage a car in a couple of months, not 6 years.

If that were not the case, everyone would be driving fleet rental re-solds...

And while you are considering things (factors in stat terms), how about
city vs. highway driving ratios, owner vs. dealer service, extreme weather
or environment, adherence (sp?) to maintenance schedules, whether the car
has ever been in an accident, number of different drivers of the same car

Oh, well... I have to admit that the most disgusting feature of
Volvo's is their marketing. It looks like Volvo uses something like
"Do you dare to risk your family in any car?" attitude, which is quite
annoying in the long run.

But now Volvo has produced a new  good car, the Volvo 850. Front drive,
2.4 L 20 valves motor, completely new chassis etc. Even the British magazine
"CAR" liked it (and believe me, that is quite much for a Volvo). And
the American magazine "Road & Track" said that "This is not your uncle
Olof's car", and in a positive sense.

But in any case, I'd still like to own the 960 estate. Strong, tank-like
chassis, 3.0L inline six, rear drive. :-) :-)

BTW, the only car drivers who have blocked me are Land Rover or Jaguar
drivers... :-) :-) :-) :-)

What? You mean what I drive? A cheapo Japanese (a Toyota) of course,
I do not have money for a *car*. (like BMW, Merc, Jaguar, Saab 9000, 
Volvo 850 (or 960), etc)
If I had the money, I would have *bad* problems deciding which one
to buy :-) :-) :-).

We had those f*****g photo-radar things here in Sweden a while ago.
There was a lot of fuzz about them, and a lot of sabotage too (a spray-can
with touch-up paint can do a lot of good...).

Eventually they had to drop the idea as there were a lot of court-cases
where the owner of the car could prove he didn't drive it at the time
of speeding.

I especially recall a case where it eventually proved to be a car-thief that
had stolen a car and made false plates. He, ofcourse, chose a license number
of a identical car, so the photo seemed correct...

In conclosion: Photo-radar sucks, every way you look at it!

  Just found a great deal on a Clifford Delta car alarm, $450 installed.  
Comes with glass break sensor, motion detector, and shock detector.  Does 
anyone have one of these alarms?  Are they any good?  From the looks of it, its
about the best on the market for the price.  It's also on sale, so that's 
another reason to get it.  I think I'll be saving almost $200.  Any opinions?

Land Crusier is just simply nice with shit-load of power and room.
Fully stocked, it cost ~$40,000.  I think it is worth the money.
Only problem is when you get into accident(it doesn't usually break down
unless you forget to get a oil change for 30000 miles or something
stupid like this), body parts and other parts are very hard to locate. 
Parts are over priced also.  One of my friend had accident in past snow
storm and he is still waiting for front bumper and passenger side fender.

Well, if you test drive Land Cruiser, all other SUV look like toys.
One of magazine writer called it "Land Bruiser".  

If you have $40,000 to spare for SUV, get Land Cruiser and forget Lange Rover.

Yes, there is:  consumer confusion.  In the early 80's with the
fuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage.  Diesel fuel
was the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage
than comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their
350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Big
mistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The engine
could not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems with
these cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer --
DON"T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.

Ask yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving,
LOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper
in the short run) vehicle?  What do Greyhound busses have in them?
Trailer Trucks?  Even Train Locomotives?  Are these gasoline engines?
No, they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a
500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.

I own an `82 Diesel Suburban.  The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine.
Just keeps going.  It was more expensive (when new) than the gasoline
engine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that 
when they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350
engine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about
$2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long
and gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline engine
costs about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injection
pump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again,
you never need a tune-up.

If you're looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, I'd say you got a great deal.
Check to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also.

Good luck.

A "fuel injector cleaning" at the dealer is probably little more than
them opening your gas tank, dumping in a bottle of fuel injector cleaner,
and sending you on your merry way $59 poorer.  Go to KMart and buy the
cleaner yourself for $1.29.

Mercedes-Benz announced yesterday its plans to begin building sport-utility

Did anyone see a picture?   Is it the G-wagon (Gelaendewagen) currently

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There is a picture in the May 1993 edition of European Car (although,
it may not be on the shelf yet).

Some things that the article says:

	- prototype has front wheel drive (first front drive
	  for Mercedes since the beginning of WWII)

	- wheelbase 3.15m
	- 7 seater
	- they claim that the price will be about the same as a
	  Renault Espace or Chrysler Voyager (DM 50,000)

Looking at the picture (slightly disguised) it looks like the Ford
Aerostar, to me.

This should not be the case if they are at all reputable. Fuel injector 
cleaning is done properly with a can of injector cleaner solvent which is
hooked up to the fuel system under high pressure. The car is actually run on
the solvent during the cleaning process. The equipment to properly do this is
pricey, and generally not something the average home mechanic has. The solvent
itself is not very expensive ($5-$8) and you could probably make up a hose to
fit your system and do it yourself, but I didn't tell you that... :-)

Not many in-tank cleaners are worth wasting your money on. There has been a 
discussion of these products on here from time to time, and Chevron Techron
(not Pro-Gard with Techron) is generally regarded as the best. It is, however,
a bit more than $1.29 a bottle. IMHO, it will not substitute for proper
injector cleaning if they are really crudded up. You'll have to decide if the
$59 price is a better deal than spending your time and/or buying equipment to
do it.

Brake rotors and the clutch are the main things.  There has been a clutch 
replacement program; you might check to see if the car is still eligible, 
as it is a change well worth making.  You can also swap the cruddy cable 
shifter for the newer rod shifter, also a change worth making, but that'll 
cost you some $$.

My brakes usually do one wibble-wobble on startup, so that is probably 
normal.  Didn't know they had a self-test, that's interesting.

What kind of tires does the car have on it?

Say, you bought your Saturn at $13k, with a dealer profit of $2k.
If the dealer profit is $1000, then you would only be paying $12k for
the same car.  So isn't that saving money?

Moreover, if Saturn really does reduce the dealer profit margin by $1000, 
then their cars will be even better deals.  Say, if the price of a Saturn was
already $1000 below market average for the class of cars, then after they
reduce the dealer profit, it would be $2000 below market average.  It will:

1) Attract even more people to buy Saturns because it would SAVE THEM MONEY.
 
2) Force the competitors to lower their prices to survive.

Now, not only will Saturn owners benefit from a lower dealer profit, even 
the buyers for other cars will pay less.

Isn't that saving money?

sure sounds like they got a ringer.  the 325is i drove was definitely
faster than that.  if you want to quote numbers, my AW AutoFile shows
0-60 in 7.4, 1/4 mile in 15.9.  it quotes Car and Driver's figures
of 6.9 and 15.3.  oh, BTW, these numbers are for the 325i.

i don't know how the addition of variable valve timing for 1993 affects it.
but don't take my word for it.  go drive it.

That my be, but every Volvo I've ever owned has lasted far longer than most
other cars.....
1981 Volvo 245....125,000 Miles, still on the road.
1983 Volvo 242....195,000 Miles, still on the road.
1984 Volvo 244....175,000 Miles, still on the road.
And I'll admit, the dealer repair cost is high. But with some mechanical
aptitude of your own, and finding a good indi mechanic, you can avoid most
breakdowns, and make the rest cheap(The sum total of the repairs on the car with
195,000 miles has been 2 mufflers and a radiator. Whoa. Bad repair record). 
And all of these cars are driven fairly hard. None of them are at the head of
a line of cars going 30 MPH....the first two spend a lot of their operating
life with the speedometer pegged...and the only reason the 84 doesn't is it has
a 120 MPH speedo...
What I want to know is....have all you people who hate Volvos been traumatized
by someone in a 745 Turbo wagon blowing you away on the road, or what?

Subject: 1993 Infiniti G20


I am thinking about getting an Infiniti G20.
In consumer reports it is ranked high in many
catagories including highest in reliability index for compact cars.
Mitsubushi Galant was second followed by Honda Accord).

A couple of things though:
1) In looking around I have yet to see anyone driving this
   car. I see lots of Honda's and Toyota's.
2) There is a special deal where I can get an Infinity G20, fully
   loaded, at dealer cost (I have check this out and the numbers match
   up). They are doing this because they are releasing and update mid-1993
   version (includes dual air-bags) and want to get rid of their old 1993's.

I guess my question is: Is this a good deal? 
Also, Can anyone give me any feedback on Infiniti?

Thanks,

Carl Hoffman

P.S.

The other cars that I have test driven and which are in the
running are:
Mitsubishi Galant, Honda Accord, and Toyota Camary

Doesn't work too well if the engine is hot, its more accurate to check the
oil when the engine is cool, i.e. not when you are at a gas station.

Why don't you look again at Motor Trend's, slalom times, they are 67.9, right
along with the Integra, and the car does that with small 14 inch tires that
are all -weather XGTV4, not to mention that the Integra rides alot better than
a Beretta.
Your acceleartion times also vary, magazine to magazine
Road & Track and Car& Driver have the GS-R at 6.8 to 8.0 for Road and Track.
Also Quarter mile times vary from 15.4 to 16.1
You can't tell exactly by the numbers.  Furthermore, the Integra will
definately outrun the Beretta on the high end.  Car & Driver and Road & track
have the GS-R doing 136 to 141 mph, and it gets there fast.

***You always believe those exact numbers, why don't you drive a GS-R, and see
for your self, while the GS-R has a low 117 torqye, its high gearing over a 8000
rpm make up for the difference (still wouldn't call it a torque moster though!)

Quad 4 reliable, yeah, what's your definition of reliable- if that's reliable,
then its safe to say that integra engines in general are near perfect
 (not to mention, a hell of alot smoother and quieter - balance shafts.The Acura has the engine
   wins the reliablity contest hands down. You can rev that car all day, everyday,
and you'll never blow a hose, or crack the block, or anything else. (I speak
from expierence!)
I'm not saying the Quad 4 is a bad engine, but don't highlight reliability when you
comparing it to a Acura Engine.  AND while the Integra costs alot more, it is a
better investment since it will hold its value considerably much better.  And
does a nice job at being a sporty car and practical at the same time.

NOTE: this isn't a flame on the GTZ, or other GM Quad 4 products.  THe Berreta
is a nice car, and puts out respectable performance and a very reasonable
price not to mention, it has an Airbag.  But to start quoting figures from one
source, isn't too reliable.  Read other sources, and drive both cars.  While I
haven't driven a GTZ, I have driven GTs, and Grand Ams with Quad 4 engines,
(so they are similair.)

Any advice on HOW to buy a Land Cruiser? My local Toyota dealer says they
get two a year, and if I want one I can just get on the waiting list.
Forget about a test drive or even kicking the tires.
And if they are that rare, I doubt there is much of a parts inventory on
hand.

	Yes, there are still alot of MGBs out there.  The earlier cars (pre
 74-1/2) are usually more desirable due to certain things that went with having 
chrome bumpers (ride height, generally more power).  The older cars are 
appreciating... slowly.  The newer ones seem to be at a stable level at the 
moment.  $6 to $8k would require extremely good condition and low miles.
If the car is in good shape and regular maintenance is kept up on it, the car 
should last for a long time.  There are still plenty of parts sources ouththere. 
 The MGB is a great, fun little car.  If she is keeping it solely in the hopes 
that it is going to appreciate, tell her to sell it.  It is not worth waiting 
the time it would take to appreciate to a real profitable level.

Subject: Re: Advice on BMWs and winter driving

This past winter I drove from NYC to Killington,VT 6 or 7 times in my
1990 325i Convertible (talk about poor reputation in the snow!!)
with an EXCELLENT set of snow tires. I put 4 Noika NR10s on in Dec. and have been 
sure footed in some pretty severe weather conditions ever since. I've plowed through
4 - 5 inch snow covered roads effortlessly, while other cars have been paralyzed
(front wheel drive included).

Concentrate more on "where the rubber meets the road" rather than driveability of cars
in snowy conditions. Drive carefully, buy good snow tires, and most cars will perform
adequately in less than ideal conditions.

An aside: 
I can't praise Noika NR10 snows enough. Absolutely the BEST snow tires I have ever
driven on. If you live in the snow belt, do yourself a favor and get a set of these
next winter.

Any reason you are limited to the two mentioned? They aren't really at
the same point along the SUV spectrum - not to mention price range.
How about the Explorer, Trooper, Blazer, Montero, and if the budget
allows, the Land Cruiser? 
Bear in mind that 90% of all SUV's purchased never venture off-road.
Carefully weigh the trade-off between comfort and off-road performance
when choosing one, and realistically decide whether you'll actually
make enough use of the off-road-ability to sacrifice (some of) the
on-road comfort.

How many people will actually put that money in the bank and keep it there for the

extended warranty is worth it.....for some people it is worth it...others not, and
for some the peace of mind knowing you won't have too many unexpected expenses
is enough.....if you drive a lot, your basic warranty can be up in a little longer than
a year....how many people can make the car payments as well as large repairs....

It may work for some people......

This has me thinking.  Is there a biological reason why women can't put
their keys in their pants pockets like men do?  I have two pockets on the
back of each of my pants.  I put my keys in one and wallent in another.
Many of the pockets even have a botton on them so I can close them securely.
Everything is that much simpler for me.  Why can't women do the same?
Is is biological (ie, not enough room for a bigger bottom plus keys and
a wallet) or is it the way they are raised by the parents?

Subject: '93 Ford Probe GT -- Engine problems?

One of the local dealers has a used (7k miles) '93 Probe GT
on the lot with a photocopy of a document taped to the
window saying the dealership bought the car back from
the previous owner because of "Engine noises", but that
the Ford district rep had OK'ed the car saying those
noises were "normal".  I thought it was worth looking
into (the car seems otherwise clean) and mentioned this
to a co-worker, who proceeded to tell me a horror story
about her son's '93 Probe GT, which had several problems,
ending with engine noises which she said "was something
with the heads", that Ford acknowledged the noise, said
they were working on it, but didn't have a cure as of
yet.  Her son traded the car in (and I checked -- not
the same car).  So I have some evidence of a reoccuring
problem with the V6 in the Probe GT's, and by extension
with the Madza 626 and MX-6.

Anything to this?  I'd love to consider buying the GT (I'm
turning 40 -- time for my scheduled mid life crisis :-)
but I'd hate to find out I just became the proud owner
of a Lemon.

It's great that all these other cars can out-handle, out-corner, and out-

But, you've got to ask yourself one question: do all these other cars have
a moonroof with a sliding sunshade?  No wimpy pop-up sunroofs or power
sliding roofs that are opaque.  A moonroof that can be opened to the air,
closed to let just light in, or shaded so that nothing comes in.

We're considering getting a Ford Explorer XLT with 4WD and we have the
following questions (All we would do is go skiing -- no off-roading):

1. With 4WD, do we need the "performance axle" - (limited slip axle).
Its purpose is to allow the tires to act independently when the tires
are on different terrain. 

2. Do we need the all-terrain tires (P235/75X15) or will the
all-season (P225/70X15) be good enough for us at Lake Tahoe?


Thanks,

Bottom line:  I did it and it worked.

Some 'tips and techniques' are included here:

I found that I needed some smaller sockets to undo the shocks.
And a can of WD40 helped...

The sockets needed were metric (exact fit) but I was able to use
some SAE sockets...  13/16 and 15/16 are rather close to 21 and 24mm...
It CAN be fun having a Canadian Ford ...

>Sounds about right.

Didn't have to undo the end bolts/bushings.  Just the 2 U bolts on
each side and the shock absorber.  Jacking up the frame some more
(had to put the spare tire on the garage floor and put a wooden 
platform on top of that to get the 'floor jack' high enough to
raise the frame ... I't one TALLL truck...) lifted the spring
free of the axel.  Taking out the block gave me enough room to
undo the pin holding the spring pack together.

The spring pack was held together with a nut on top and a round head
on the other end....  No wrench head...  Vice Grips worked fine...
I soaked the nut with WD40 and it came right off.

Flipped the bottom spring and then...

>Well, it's easier than doing a decent trigger job on a 1911A1 :-)
>(OK, well, maybe it's not _that_ easy, but it's not terribly

I donno ... I'm a little more sore today than after working on a
1911A1 ...

A 1.5 foot pipe cheater was a real help.  Torque spec for the U bolt
nuts is 150 to 200 ft-lbs (!).   A 1911-A1 doesn't have that kind of
torque spec ...

It was a 'challenge' to get the 'pack bolt' back in the spring pack.  
Squeeze pack with two hands, hold bolt with third, put nut on
with fourth while picking up wrench and vice grips with fifth
and sixth hands ...  I used some string to tie the pack together
while holding the pin in for alignment... then I could let go
to get the {nut, wrench, Vice Grips...}.

Getting the pin back lined up with the lift block was a challenge too...
until I discovered that the axel had 1) Tilted and/or 2) rolled forward.

One the drivers side, a bottle jack under the front of the differential
tilted it back in line enough for the pin head to drop into the right
hole.  On the passenger side, I had to wrestle the wheel into rolling
forward about 1/2 inch to get things to line up.  Spent more than an
hour working on getting the pin head into the hole in the lift block
with levers and ropes and impliments of distruction before I took a 
break and thought about WHY it wasn't lined up anymore (since it HAD
been lined up before, and *I* didn't move it, something ELSE must 
have ... hmmm, axle no longer constrained not to move ... hmmm, move 
it back... hmmm...).

After that, it was all much easier to 'close up'.

BTW, the ride is now softer, but not quite as soft as I was hoping for.
At least it now sits level..

My Honda has a cable release that can be locked out with the ignition key.
The valet key can be left with someone and will NOT unlock the trunk
or enable the cable release.

I remember my mothers '86 Corvette that had an electronic hatch release
located on the drivers door, which was ALWAYS active.  The fact that the
car had no real trunk makes the security measure of beign able to 
dis-able the hatch release unnecessary.

 My friend brought a subaru SVX recently.  I had drove it for couples times and I
think its a great car, esp on snow.  However when she took it to a local Subaru
dealer for a oil change, the bill came out to be about 80 dollars.  The dealer
told us it is because to change the oil filter on a SVX it is necessary to
disassemble a metal cover under the engine and that took an hour of labour.
At first, we think we are being ripped off so she phone to a dealer in Toronto
but found out the they are charging roughly the same price.  So is there any
SVX owner out there that has the same problem ?  And if the oil change story is
true, then the engineer of Subaru looks pretty stubid to me. By the way, the car
looks great.

Comparing the GTZ and GSR is apples to oranges, somewhat like a Mustang 5.0
and a CRX, both have very different ways of doing things and ought to
appeal to different buyers, i.e., I don't think an Acura owner would
be seen dead in a Chevy dealership or vice versa.

The C+D figures are almost certainly bogus and based on a hot prototype

The GSR gearing is horrible for day to day driving. It needs a 6 speed
box more than any other modern car. Essentially 5th in a regualr Integra
equals 4th in the GSR, and the regular Integras are very buzzy at speed.

The only GSR owner I know had the engine throw a rod with less than 5k

Both the GTZ and GSR are flawed cars. The performance enthusiasts would take
the GTZ and the CR purchase would be the GSR.

Grass Roots Motorsport [3/93] has a long article about MG/B's this month.
As far as collectivity/speculation is concerned they think it is a 
waste of time, especially the later rubber bumpered models are the least
desirable, a 1962 original model the most. The reasons for its low
value are easy availability and the fact that it just was not a very good

Your Passat VR6 is designed to run on premium gasoline, however the
engine electronics will retard the timing so that no harm wil be done
to the engine with lower octane fuel.

You will likely, however, get somewhat more power and fuel mileage
(especially in hot weather) out of this particular engine if you do

ABS, with four wheel disk breaks.  The LH cars won Automobile 
magazines 
"automobile of the year" award, and are quiet impressive.

  I won't argue too much about anything.  I am probably one of those that 
think that we can't have enough safety on the roads.  I would gladly 
sacrifice distractions (as you call it), than someone having trouble seeing
danger earlier.  One saved life justifies more than my lifetime of "distractions"
for me.

   Problem is that, I may just kill the guy. I agree that I would be at fault,
and I will have my license revoked, why, I might even go to the gas chamber.
But the fact still remains that the guy is dead.  Someone died because I
was too stingy to put on my lights.

   The ratio of the probability of fallen trees/rocks on the roads to 
oncoming traffic is too low to even be considered.  The difference is also
working on what we *know* could happen, to what *might* happen.

  Compared to the number of gallons of gas consumed by those 200 million cars,
it is miniscule!

not concerned with safety.

Oh PULLEEZE!

It's not biology at all, it's clothing design.  Women's clothing is
generally designed to be as non-functional as possible.  It's only been
in the last five years or so that you could buy women's pants with
pockets deep enough to carry anything in.  Previously, deep pockets were
virtually unknown in women's clothing.  Skirts generally have better
pockets now, too.  Dresses, espcially fancy dresses, are still pretty
hopeless.  I often hand my driver's license over to my husband if we're
dressed up to go out somewhere, so I don't have to be encumbered by a
purse.

If women consistently bought functional clothing, and boycotted the
manufacturers who refuse to make functional women's clothing, I think
manufacturers would tend to bow to market pressures.  There's
an interesting chapter in Susan Faludi's Backlash that described
what happened the LAST time clothing manufacturers ignored the
need for functional women's clothing.  The manufactuing industry
lost millions.

From a woman who would rather buy men's clothing WITH decent pockets and
long legs and high waists than women's clothing without....

 Seems that the 1993 Mustang 5.0 is rated at 205 hp ONLY because Ford
 changed its testing procedures.  Under the older procedures, it still 
 rates closer to 225 hp.  That means that the Mustang has 3 hp more.
 
 And you still haven't posted any weight figures for the Mustang.

 Yeah, sure, in your wet dreams.  And that's probably where you got

       No way, Sentra's are SLOW!  I took a test drive and it took

In article <foo> Brad Thone <C09615BT@WUVMD> writes:
Well, there *is* a difference.

I don't happen to have my SAE manual handy, but oil viscosity in general
_decreases_ with temperature.  The SAE numbers are based on a `typical'
curve that oils used to all have, running from (say) the viscosity of a
room-temperature 90-weight at 0C, down to (say) that of a room-temperature 
5-weight at 20C, for a typical 40-weight oil.

Oils that are designed for operation in `normal' temperatures just have
a weight specification.  Oils that are designed for operation in exceedingly
cold temperatures have a `W' tacked on the end, so in winter in a cold
place, you'd stick 10W in your car in the winter and 40 in it in the summer,
to approximate the appropriate viscosity throughout the year.

Modern multi-viscosity oils change viscosity much less with temperature.
As a result, their viscosity graphs cross over several curves.  A multi-vis
specification pegs the curve at two temperatures, a `normal' operating
temperature and a `cold' one (though I can't remember the numbers...).

In any event, the weights do indicate a significant difference.  Remember
that your engine is temperature-regulated (by the thermostat and
radiator or air fins) most of the time -- unless you overheat it or
something.

Any weight of oil is better than no oil, or than very old, carbonized
oil.  Thin oil won't (in general) lubricate as well at temperature,
thicker oil will (like a 20W50) will lubricate better at temperature, 
but not as well during startup, when most engine wear occurs.  

If you're planning on making long drives, the 20W50 is probably fine
(esp. in the summer) in your 10W40 car.  But if you're making short drives,
stick to the 10W40.

These arethe numbers I have been stating in the past 5-10 messages. It
really angers me that you insisted you were right, and that you had
no clue what your own car weighed. Why didn't you check when I first
told you that your figures were implausible?

No, sorry your wrong again. *You* quoted the del Sol as doing 0-60 in
8.1 according to C+D. Interestingly, the Stealth ES, which is
*faster* than your RT does the samerun in 8.5 seconds according to
C+D. Kind of embarassing isn't it? Why didn't you check the figures

before posting? It only makes you look stupid when you are caught out
twice with *your own* figures.

If you insist, I gave you every chance to retract, but:

  Dodge Stealth ES Auto does an 8.5/16.4 - Wonder why you couldn't find it?

Do you realize that a 9k Sentra (C+D) will run a 16.7, that a Sentra SE-R or Saturn
will run in the 15's? Don't you think it is kind of strange that your
222hp sports car is so easily beaten. 

A Mustang 5.0, which weights about the same (according to *your* numbers),
has less power and is much quicker? Care to explain. Don't be abusive,
just try and come up with a rational explanation of where those 222hp
went to, its a mystery to me.

By the 1920s, there was a very active "good roads" movement, which had
its origins actually in the 1890s during the bicycle craze, picked up
steam in the teens (witness the Linclon Highway Association, 1912 or so,
and the US highway support act (real name: something different) in 1916
that first pledged federal aid to states and counties to build decent
roads. Also, the experience of widespread use of trucks for domestic
transport during WW 1 convinced the government that good raods were
crucial to our national defense.  Anyway, by the 20s there were plenty
of good roads, at least around urban areas, and they were rapidly
expanding into the countryside.  This was the era, after all, of the
first auto touring fad, the motel, the auto camp ground, etc. Two good
books on the subject spring to mind - Warren Belasco "America on the
Road" (title may not be exact - author is) and another called "The Devil
Wagon in God's Country" author I forget.  Also, any of John Flink's  or
John Bell Rae's auto histories.

As to placement of the steering wheel being arbitrary, by the early
teens there were virtually no American cars that did not have the wheel
on the left.  In the early days, cars had the wheel on the left, on the
right, and even in the middle, as well as sometimes having a tiller
instead of a wheel.  This was standardized fairly early on, though I
don't know why.

--Let me put it like this.  The only similarity between the three models
  is the "300", or 3-liter engine displacement.  Actually, the SC300 (the
  coupe) and the GS300 (the funky-looking new sedan) share the same 3.0
  liter inline-six, and the ES300 (popular small sedan) uses 3.0 V6 shared
  with the Camry.  The SC300 is a luxury/sports coupe, the GS300 is the new
  luxury sedan, and the ES300 is the base executive sedan.  All three look
  completely different.

	Yes.  But the point is that prices are competetive.  Saturn may
well be selling a car intended on giving the dealer a $2000 profit, but 
since a comperable Honda with $500 profit is more expensive, it may be well
worth it to buy the Saturn.

	Not necessarily.  It seems to me that Saturn salesdroids, who don't 
make a commision, whereas their counterparts at other dealerships generally
do, make more $$ per hour or whatever.  This means that Saturn doesn't give up
the profit to their employees through commision, which IS taken out of per-
car profits.  They just pass it along to less pressureing salesmen/women.

>Isn't that saving money?

	Maybe.  Maybe not.  Depends on accounting practices.  I'd rather pay
more for dealer service that doesn't cut corners to contain costs...

My T-Bird SC's manual says to replace the platinum plugs every 60,000mi.
Wal-Mart has Autolite platinum plugs for $2.00 each. Are these "real"
platinum plugs? (I had Bosch platinums in my '80 Fiesta and my dad
had 'em in his '84 Bronco--note the keyword "had." They didn't last
very long (much less than 50,000mi) before they had to be replaced.
I agree that they weren't the greatest.)

	I agree that a fully-loaded SL2 would come close in price to a
LOWER-END Ford Taurus.  A FULLY-LOADED Taurus, on the other hand, would still
be substantially more expensive than even the most glitzy SL2.  A fully loaded
SL2 would run somewhere around $17,000, while a fully loaded Taurus LX would be
somewhere around the $22,000-$23,000 range.  A base Taurus (GL I believe) might
start around $15,000.  Of course there is the Taurus SHO which can push $30,000
if you really try, but this is a totally different car than your mainstream
Taurus sedan.  Your statement was not entirely faulty, just a little
inaccurate.

Well, that's ok.  At least you're not bitching about dealer profits like some
of the other netters are.  You seem to have rationally picked out the car that
is best for you.  The Loyale is an aging design that is about to be replaced by
the Impreza wagon, so you probably got a good deal on one of the last ones.

	My GS came with XGT V4s and they are NOT all weather tires.  I took
out my right front bumper sliding on packed snow (not ice), before I learned
this fact.  I immediately bought XGT H4s which are definately all-weather.
A Carrera 4 I walk by everyday has XGT V4s on it even.  The Michelin dealer
where I bought my new tires said the V4s were made out of a different 
rubber that gets really hard and slick when the weather gets near feezing.  
Said he'd only try to sell me those tires during the winter if we were in
Texas and not Colorado.

While your 0-60 time is consistent with most car magazines and reports, I saw
the PBS MotorWeek show clock a 5-speed SL2 at 7.9 seconds.  I'm sure that most
SL2 owners will be VERY lucky to get this speed, but 7.9 seconds is still
astonishingly fast for a small 4-door.  A new Civic EX runs about 8.2 seconds
0-60, if I'm not mistaken.  Most cars in this class are lucky to be in the
9-second range.

   As I live in Sweden I remember the day perfectly well. We changed
side 1967-09-03 (or 03-SEP-1967). I don't remeber the exactly time but
it was in the night. (in the 'big' cities like Stockholm & Gothenburg
all trafic was forbidden, exept busses and taxis, during the whole
weekend.) The day was a Sunday and everything was prepared in before.

Before the day we was told to follow the yellow lines on the road and
after it was the white one that matters. The signs with arrows on was
prepared with a 'left mode' label that was torn off that night to
reveal the new right mode arrow.

The year after Iceland also changed.

About cars: Before the H-day (H as in "Hoegertrafik". "hoeger" is
Swedish and stands for 'right') practically all cars already had their
steering wheels on the left side. Even the imported cars from UK had
the wheel on 'the right side'. At last we have cars with the wheels on
the right side. :-)

More contries that uses the left side is:

Japan
Tanzania (I think)
New Zeeland
How about South Africa?

BTW. Some sais that the left side is the right side because Ivanhoe
and other knights meet at the left when they fight in tournaments. :-)

740 Turbo in UK was good for 124mph. Useful for blowing away VW Beetles, though I
believe the Beetle corners better. 

I can say without any doubt that I have never been blown away by any Volvo, ever.
I've been blocked into a few car parks though by shit-head Volvo owners who 'only thought they'd be a few minutes'. This does not happen with the owners of any other makes of car.

Not sure how long the small shit-box Volvos last - too damn long. The worst car I ever drove was a hired 340. In power, handling and ride it was reminiscent of something
from the 50s, without the character. The 340 only ceased production a couple of years back. I've only been a passenger in the big Volvos, but that was enough. I ought to go
for a test drive because they offer some neat gifts.

I understand Caddy is working on one, double battery, super high perf

the works. Color selection is limited though. 

The problem is that the guy at 1600 Penn. Avenue is about to get it

Not to my knowledge; I know GM does conversion work for things like 
hot climates (i.e. the Chevy Caprices sold to the Middle East) but 
things like that are always done by third parties, NOT the manufacturer.
Maybe you will need to buy a specific package that has beefed-up everything,
perhaps the police cruiser package on the Caprice/Crown Vic and start from
there.

"And I wuz drivin' along in my armored Seville STS and this punk pulls out
of nowhere with an RPG (Rocket Propelled Grenade) but the bulletproof
windshield stopped him" :-) Don't think many people on the net have a need
for bulletproof cars. 

Check with local armored service companies/security/bodyguard places. They'd
know best. I think your average luxury car dealer will have a coronary if
you told them "I'll take the blue Caprice, with options FZ01 (Fuzzy Dice),
PR11 (power everything), and AR007 (Armor).

Bad driving habits can damage a car in a couple of months, not 6 years.

If that were not the case, everyone would be driving fleet rental re-solds...

And while you are considering things (factors in stat terms), how about
city vs. highway driving ratios, owner vs. dealer service, extreme weather
or environment, adherence (sp?) to maintenance schedules, whether the car
has ever been in an accident, number of different drivers of the same car

I agree.  Six hour long stretches behind the wheel really make me

Oh, well... I have to admit that the most disgusting feature of
Volvo's is their marketing. It looks like Volvo uses something like
"Do you dare to risk your family in any car?" attitude, which is quite
annoying in the long run.

But now Volvo has produced a new  good car, the Volvo 850. Front drive,
2.4 L 20 valves motor, completely new chassis etc. Even the British magazine
"CAR" liked it (and believe me, that is quite much for a Volvo). And
the American magazine "Road & Track" said that "This is not your uncle
Olof's car", and in a positive sense.

But in any case, I'd still like to own the 960 estate. Strong, tank-like
chassis, 3.0L inline six, rear drive. :-) :-)

BTW, the only car drivers who have blocked me are Land Rover or Jaguar
drivers... :-) :-) :-) :-)

What? You mean what I drive? A cheapo Japanese (a Toyota) of course,
I do not have money for a *car*. (like BMW, Merc, Jaguar, Saab 9000, 
Volvo 850 (or 960), etc)
If I had the money, I would have *bad* problems deciding which one
to buy :-) :-) :-).

We had those f*****g photo-radar things here in Sweden a while ago.
There was a lot of fuzz about them, and a lot of sabotage too (a spray-can
with touch-up paint can do a lot of good...).

Eventually they had to drop the idea as there were a lot of court-cases
where the owner of the car could prove he didn't drive it at the time
of speeding.

I especially recall a case where it eventually proved to be a car-thief that
had stolen a car and made false plates. He, ofcourse, chose a license number
of a identical car, so the photo seemed correct...

In conclosion: Photo-radar sucks, every way you look at it!

Subject: Clifford Delta car alarm?


  Just found a great deal on a Clifford Delta car alarm, $450 installed.  
Comes with glass break sensor, motion detector, and shock detector.  Does 
anyone have one of these alarms?  Are they any good?  From the looks of it, its
about the best on the market for the price.  It's also on sale, so that's 
another reason to get it.  I think I'll be saving almost $200.  Any opinions?

Land Crusier is just simply nice with shit-load of power and room.
Fully stocked, it cost ~$40,000.  I think it is worth the money.
Only problem is when you get into accident(it doesn't usually break down
unless you forget to get a oil change for 30000 miles or something
stupid like this), body parts and other parts are very hard to locate. 
Parts are over priced also.  One of my friend had accident in past snow
storm and he is still waiting for front bumper and passenger side fender.

Well, if you test drive Land Cruiser, all other SUV look like toys.
One of magazine writer called it "Land Bruiser".  

If you have $40,000 to spare for SUV, get Land Cruiser and forget Lange Rover.

The CR purchase would be the Ford Probe GT.

Yes, there is:  consumer confusion.  In the early 80's with the
fuel crisis, etc., everyone wanted better fuel mileage.  Diesel fuel
was the cheapest fuel available and usually provides better mileage
than comparable gasoline engines.  So, GM decided to conver their
350 gas engine into a diesel engine (I think was a 5.7 liter).  Big
mistake.  The engine was not redesigned, but converted.  The engine
could not handle the higher compression, etc.  Lots of problems with
these cars.  This thew up a big red flag to the casual observer --
DON"T BUY A DIESEL.  THEY ARE BAD.  This was a gross generalization.

Ask yourself this question -- if your livelihood depended on driving,
LOTS of it, would you use a dependable or undependable (but cheaper
in the short run) vehicle?  What do Greyhound busses have in them?
Trailer Trucks?  Even Train Locomotives?  Are these gasoline engines?
No, they are diesel.  Tractor trailer truck manufacturers provide a
500,000 mile warrantee with they vehicles.

I own an `82 Diesel Suburban.  The 6.2L diesel is a GREAT engine.
Just keeps going.  It was more expensive (when new) than the gasoline
engine vehicle was.  The only problem with diesel engines is that 
when they need to be rebuilt, they are expensive.  In a gas 350
engine, you will pay about $1000 for a rebuild.  Diesel 6.2L is about
$2000.  But then again, the diesel engine lasts about twice as long
and gets about 50% better mileage.  A carburator for a gasoline engine
costs about $100 to rebuild (or less).  A rebuild of the fuel injection
pump on a diesel will cost about $500 (or more).  But then again,
you never need a tune-up.

If you're looking at a rebuilt 6.2L, I'd say you got a great deal.
Check to see if the fuel injection pump was rebuilt also.

Good luck.

A "fuel injector cleaning" at the dealer is probably little more than
them opening your gas tank, dumping in a bottle of fuel injector cleaner,
and sending you on your merry way $59 poorer.  Go to KMart and buy the
cleaner yourself for $1.29.
 
Just because you dealer sez you need it, don't mean it's necessarily so.
Be suspicious.

I was out of date.  VW is stealing execs directly from Opel,
independent of Lopez.  Shameful.

There is something going on here.  It seems that once a month, the VW
group must have get a specific detailed question about Hondas.  I
would like to ask that next month we get one about Hyundai instead of
Honda.  Thank you.
